# sshRunCMD

Use this software to ssh into multiple network switches at the same time to update configs. At this time (Nov 2023) SolarWinds does not support Transition Network switches which is the birth of this application. Past that we have full support for newer and older Cisco switches and are happy to add broader support for other devices if you find this doesn't work, just submit a new feature above. 

The helper file contains the encrypted local admin credentials and you can add your own credentials to the primary spot since most of our devices are managed through AD. If not you need to add your credentials on each run inside the application under File.
